🧮 0/1 Knapsack Simulator

This project is a simple web app that shows how the **0/1 Knapsack problem** is solved using **dynamic programming**, step by step.

## 📌 What It Does

- Takes input for item **weights**, **profits**, and **knapsack capacity**
- Shows the DP table being filled row by row
- Displays explanations for each step
- Highlights the maximum profit at the end

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter:
   - Item weights (like `2,3,4`)
   - Item profits (like `4,5,6`)
   - Knapsack capacity (like `5`)
3. Click **Start Simulation**
4. Use **Next Step** to go through the algorithm
